Hi !

I am Jishnu !!!!!

I am an international student from Mauritius. 

Mauritius is a small island located in the middle of the Indian Ocean. I would describe my home country as a fun destination. Living in a multicultural society has enabled me to learn different cultures and languages. I speak English, French, Mauritian Creole and some Hindi. Well, I also love science fiction; I like to read manga comics, watch action movies, play video games, and cooking. 

IF  you select me for this adventure, I will show you all the wonders of my home country. 

Cheers,

Jishnu
