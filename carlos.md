Hi !

I am Carlos!!!!!

I am an international student from Colombia.

Colombia is a country known for its incredible biodiversity and delicious coffee. It is the world's largest producer of emeralds and has stunning landscapes like the Amazon rainforest and the Andes Mountains. Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez won the Nobel Prize in Literature, and famous singer Shakira hails from Colombia. The Carnaval de Barranquilla is a lively carnival celebrated in the city of Barranquilla. Colombians are passionate about soccer, and the country has a rich soccer culture.

IF you select me for this adventure, I will show you all the wonders of my home country.

Cheers,

Carlos.
